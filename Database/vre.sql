INSERT INTO `vre_algorithms` VALUES (2,28,'Genetic Algorithm','“Genetic Algorithms (GA) are a class of algorithm, which are powerful optimisation tools that imitate the natural process of evolution and Darwin’s principal of ‘Survival of the Fittest’. In the process of evolution, weaker individuals tend to die off and stronger ones tend to live longer and reproduce. GAs optimise in a similar manner, by simulating the Darwinian evolutionary process and naturally occurring genetic operators on chromosomes (Davis, 1991) (Holland, 1992). GAs are used to solve extremely complex search and optimisation problems which prove difficult using analytical or simple enumeration methods. GAs do not examine sequentially but by searching in parallel mode using a multi-individual population,  where each individual is being examined at the same time (Goldberg, 1989).” (O’Donnell 2006)','In the beer game human players can be replaced by artificial agents. The artificial agents are then often guided by genetic algorithms. Research has shown that virtual agents are able track demand, eliminate the Bullwhip effect, discover the optimal policies (where they are known), and find good policies under complex scenarios where analytical solutions are not available (Kimbrough 2002). Factors such as the complexity of the customer demand pattern are prone to affect the outcome of the optimization by genetic algorithms.',NULL,0),(12,46,'FAtiMA Architecture','Each agent in the world (the character) perceives the environment through a set of sensors (allowing the\n\nperception of events, objects, etc. in the world) and acts within the environment through its effectors. In order to achieve believable and expressive agents, their behaviour is influenced by their emotional state and personality. FAtiMA models emotions based on the OCC cognitive appraisal theory of emotions, where emotions are defined as valanced (good or bad) reactions to events.\n\nWhenever the agent receives a perception, the agent appraises its significance and triggers the appropriate emotions. Additionally, if a goal becomes active, it will add a new intention to achieve the active goal in the agent’s mind.\n\nThe agent’s mind architecture is shown in Figure. Given the several components that constitute such minds, for each agent built (thus, for each autonomous actor in our cast), the author needs to define a set of elements that includes among other things their goals and action tendencies that can be triggered by a particular emotional state of the agent. These action tendencies represent the character\'s impulsive and hardwired actions which he performs without thinking (reactive actions), and are implemented according to each character’s personality.','The purpose of the use of this architecture is to promote the emotional consistency and consequently the characters believability in a role play scenario.',NULL,0),(13,46,'Story Facilitator','The Story Facilitator’s tasks can be described in a cycle that is repeated until the story ends.\n\nAt the very beginning (Start) the SF loads all the episodes for the story and puts them in the Story Memory. It then selects an episode that has an empty set of preconditions and marks that episode as selected so it will not be selected again.\n\nThe SF will then execute all the Narrative Actions contained in the selected episode’s intro/set-up. Each time a character that is not controlled by a user is inserted on the set, the SF reads that character’s properties and stores them in the Story Memory, and then sends the character’s goals listed in the selected episode to the agent that is responsible for controlling the character. After the intro/set-up of the episode ends, the SF hands control to the agents and user(s) controlling the characters, making the story emergent from that point on.\n\nDuring this phase, where the agents and user(s) control the characters present in the set, the SF perceives all actions performed in the virtual environment and updates the Story Memory with Story Events. If the content of the Story Memory satisfies a trigger’s condition, the SF intervenes and executes the trigger’s\nNarrative Actions. Finally, if one of the episode’s finish conditions is satisfied by the contents of the Story Memory the SF ends the current episode and uses the Story Memory to check if there are other episodes whose preconditions are satisfied. If so, the SF selects one of them as the next episode. If there is no other episode that can be selected, the SF ends the story.','In role-play the story is improvised rather than scripted and emerges from interaction between the characters involved. Since the story is emergent there is no absolute guarantee that it will convey a meaningful message.

In order to make progress in the narrative the player has to interact with objects (e.g. doing inventory of items at the warehouse) or trade with other characters (e.g. Native Americans basket waivers or Alaskan hunters). Before a new task is assigned players are invited to explore new locations and become acquainted with the environment.

FRVW features a WASD keyboard-based and “mouse-look” mouse-based movement control. The navigation can be challenging because the camera can zoom in/out and orbit 360 degrees. This camera design allows for a better point of view on the environment, but can cause an initial discomfort in non-expert users. In addition, some usability issues are due to narrow indoor passages that make the navigation of some buildings inconvenient. The camera also needs refinement because it goes through solid objects (e.g. walls and roofs) when player leaves a building or is very close to external walls.

Furthermore, the game is designed as a pre-visit tool which precedes an actual trip to FRSHP and generates positive expectations and pre-visit knowledge.

The elements found in this section of the ontology are the observed effects, or synergies, that a set of specific rules in a game might have. They describe the relationships between rules and can also describe the strategic options available to players.\nFor example, when considering a real-time strategy game in which a player must use certain resources to buy units, the costs associated to each of these units can have overall synergies and effects on the strategies used by players in the game. If the cost of a new unit increases when the player already has units of that type, there is diseconomy of scale. The marginal cost of each new element increases as more units are bought. If, on the other hand, the cost decreases, there is an economy of scale. In this example, an economy or diseconomy of scale is a rule synergy.\nRules synergies are also related to a property called emergence. Many games are simple to learn to play. They don\'t have many rules and the rules aren\'t very complex. However, knowing how to play is not sufficient to play the game well. There is more to playing games than simply memorizing the rules. (Juul, 2002) The emergent complexity of a game, can be explained in part by the synergies between rules.',5,'In In this case the game rules are quite simple  but interactions beetween rules should be considered e.g.: if competitors of the entailed business take specific actions the game rules may change accordingly; e.g: 1) services should be provided in a smaller amount of time than before  or 2) the rule of renting the lowest price machine should be changed into renting one more expensive but providing different enlarged possibilities. \nRules synergies or rather the fact that the student has to take into account  different rules (which also implies the need for considering more data and information) has a specific pedagogical function as far as cognitive functions are concerned: it requires higher order thinking skills and promotes convergent thinking.\n'),(284,36,'User interface','Screen, point-and-clic interface, performance meter. aural output.',1,NULL),(285,36,'Rules','mission, tasks',2,NULL),(286,36,'Goals','Performance records',3,NULL),(287,36,'Entity management','collect, use, pick, talk',4,NULL),(288,36,'Assessment','activity assessment',5,NULL),(292,40,'Game missions','The player is requested to accomplish specific missions about real-life problems',5,'Missions are presented each week to players.

Examples of featured values include score, energy, and whatever value is significant for the game. A more detailed page can be linked, where all the dimensions (e.g., ability in a language, in a type of game, in a learning style) of the player performance are reported, possibly also with temporal graphs and statistics about performance in this and other matches',5,']: there are 3 type of scoreboard at the top of the screen, one for points, one for cds and one for snacks. Each scoreboard has a different color and is incremented if player, during level, catches one or more of those things.\nWith this 3 types of scoreboard, player is motivated to do better, to improve his knowledge and to fully explore each level: the player has to avoid slackers, that steal his cds, and the monsters “snacks crackers” that eat his snacks.

If the answer is correct he will receive bonus points. He has to watch out for the slackers and the snack crackers who will try to steal his party goodies. At the end of each level, he will have to perform a laser task, such as recognising appliances that contain lasers and repairing faulty eyesight.

Thus, feedback on player performance is very important. A positive outcome of such verification points enables going to the next level',5,': there are summative mini-games at the end of each level. In this mini-game the player has to help people to do something and the argument of each mini-game is always laser. For example, in the first mini-game the player has to organize 40 objects above 3 different shelf. One of this type of objects uses laser technology, and so the player learns some notions about these “laser” object.

Alloway and Alloway (2010) have demonstrated that working memory is even a better predictor for scholastic achievement than intelligence. Thus working memory is also a good predictor for school-relevant tasks such as mathematical skills and reading comprehension (Buschkuehl, Jaeggi, & Jonides, 2012). Gathercole and colleagues (2006) showed that the severity of deficits in reading as well as mathematics in children with reading disabilities was closely associated with working memory. They suggest that an effective management of working memory load in structured learning activities may decreases learning problems that are associated with impairments of working memory.\n\nReferences:\nAlloway, T.

It is suitable for many neurophysiological measurements like NIRS, EEG, fMRI etc. With this game it should be possible to explore neurophysiological correlates of learning.\nThe players task is to catch falling objects (balls or squares with different colours) by pressing three predefined keys of a conventional keyboard while EEG and NIRS is recorded. The game includes two conditions: a learnable and an unlearnable condition. In the learnable condition, the objects are falling down in a learnable predefined sequence. Hence, there are some “rules”, such as every second red ball lands at the right side of the screen, which can be learned during a trial. In the unlearnable condition, objects are falling down in a completely random order.\nFor every caught object the player gets one point respectively the caught to fallen ratio increases. These points can be visually fed back to the player in the upper left corner of the screen. The goal for every player is to complete all the trials while catching as many objects as possible. The executive researcher can and has to define how many trials the player has to do.\nThe difficulty of the game is to catch the objects, which are falling down very fast, therefore the player has to react very quickly. It is more difficult to catch the objects without knowing the rules how some of the objects are falling down. Thus the learnable condition should be easier than the unlearnable condition. If the player plays the condition with learnable sequences the player has to identify the rule(s) by him- or herself. Once the rule is detected consciously or unconsciously it should be easier to catch the falling objects. So the reaction time of the player should decrease and the ratio of caught to fallen objects should increase. Therefore the executive researcher could identify through looking at these behavioural data, if the player/subject has identified the rule(s). \n As mentioned above the aim of this game is to explore neurophysiological correlates of learning. If it is possible to identify different specific brain activity patterns for the learnable and the unlearnable condition, it would maybe possible to adapt learning content through brain activity patterns. In other words: If we can identify a specific brain activity pattern when a player has learned a rule the game could automatically adapt and implement a new rule (go to the next level).\n','learning rules; psychophysiology; NIRS; EEG; UniGraz; CovUni',1,NULL,2,NULL),(36,103,'First-aid game',23,'http://first-aid-game.e-ucm.es',NULL,2012,NULL,1,1,'2013-05-14 00:00:00','2013-11-22 16:19:57',3,'The first-aid game was created to teach high school students how to perform basic first-aid and resuscitation procedures including, when available, the use of a portable defibrillator as the ones being deployed in most public spaces.

Users are guided by a series of 10 missions and quests, during 10 weeks, towards real-world challenges, like hunger, climate change and obesity. It’s a collaborative game: players accomplish each mission by uploading blog posts, photos and videos. Each week the player has to complete three steps of the mission: Learn, Act and Imagine. A topic is unlocked by posting on the game blog, and linking to personal sites, blogs or photo galleries, writing resolutions about the problems of the quest.\nThe game is based on the principle that gamification of serious problems can push players to compete to solve them. Player is encouraged by a rating system: he can obtain game credits by completing missions and quests and extra points by others players’ votes. He can also improve his ten “hero skills”: collaboration, creativity, knowledge share, resourcefulness, sustainability, courage, entrepreneurship, local insight, spark and vision.\nThis game is a power mean to reach a large mass of people for educational purpose.

Players have to learn about great problems, to read and write about them. They posts ideas, find friends, comment on projects, share information, rate the quality of the information shared, discuss, argue, create, and act. By this mean a large number of young students can think and act to improve world quality.\nEvoke is an example of alternate reality game, where a narrative world is mixed with real world, in order to stimulate players’ imagination and plunge them into the competition.\nThe name of the game and its operation is based on the African proverb “If you have a problem, and you can\'t solve it alone, evoke it.\"\nThe game began on March 3, 2010 and ended on May 12th, 2010.

Instead, they’re designed as live events, campaigns, or seasons. They happen for 24 hours, or 6 weeks, or 6 months — and then they’re archived online for future players to be inspired to run their own versions, or to continue the game however they see fit.

The final performance assessment is accurately implemented, as well:\n1)	Once users have completed all their tasks, they have the possibility to evaluate their performance during the virtual experience. Then Carlo gives learners a feedback about their performance during the game and a graphic showing the discrepancy among the users’ self-evaluation and the feedback from the system is displayed. \n2)	Finally, after the game experience learners are able to read all the notes that have been collected during gameplay into a learning diary, and reflect about their experiences.\n','Crisis-management app, 3D graphics, trial and error, first-person game',2,'There is a dedicated Tutorial session to start with in order to get familiar with commands and controls and hence being able to move and interact with the virtual environment/virtual people',3,'Notes: The game’s learning objectives are several and of a certain complexity, hence a certain time is needed to fully achieve adequate knowledge and confidence'),(56,153,'BiLAT',38,'http://ict.usc.edu/prototypes/bilat/',2004,2008,NULL,3,4,'2013-11-18 00:00:00','2013-11-19 15:45:21',5,'BiLAT is a portable-PC based training program designed with a specific objective in mind: to provide students an immersive and compelling training environment to practice their skills in conducting meetings and negotiations in a specific cultural context.','bilateral negotiation, interpersonal training, intercultural training, negotiation,',3,NULL,3,NULL),(57,105,'Fort Ross Virtual Warehouse (FRVW)',NULL,NULL,2013,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2013-11-18 00:00:00','2013-11-18 15:57:57',1,'Between 1812 and 1841 Fort Ross was a Russian fur trading outpost and multi-cultural colony located in the Northern California coast.

The game design is founded on cognitive neuropsychological theories and flow theories (flow framework). It is a working memory training game that includes different game elements to increase flow and motivation of the players. Working memory is of central importance for acquiring knowledge and is involved in a variety of complex cognitive tasks and abilities. “FreeYourBrain” uses a complex span task approach as a basic working memory training design principle. \nThe working memory training is hosted on a server so that the participants are able to perform the training online from their own computers. Participants are able to log in with their own account and the performance of each session of the training is saved in an online database. Before starting the actual training an individual highscore-table is displayed. \nThe game always starts with displaying a one-digit number (“key-digit”) followed by a simple arithmetic decision task (e.g. 5+6= 11; true or false?). The participants have to remember the “key-digit” and maintain the information until the “unlocking phase” of the game. In level 1 the participants only have to remember one “key-digit” and recall it in the “unlocking-phase”. However, participants only proceed into the “unlocking phase” if the participants are able to solve the arithmetic task correctly (Level 1). A correct answer on the arithmetic task is followed by an animation of a growing neuron (wrong answer = shrinking neuron). In the “unlocking phase” a brain is displayed (see Figure 2) and the participants have to type in the key digit(s) to unlock and free the coloured brain area. If the participants are able to remember the key digit correctly the lock on the coloured brain area unlocks and frees a part of the brain (Figure 2). \nParticipants advance into the next level if they are able to solve the displayed arithmetic task(s) and to remember the displayed key-digit(s). In level 1 the participants only have to remember one “key-digit” and solve one arithmetic decision task. The number of “key-digits” combined with the arithmetic decision task increased with the level of the game (level of difficulty). To ensure that participants always train/play at the maximum of their capabilities participants only advance in the next level of difficulty if they were able to succeed in the current level two times in a row. Likewise, failing in the current level two times in a row will result in a decrease of the level.

The Simulation Manager (usually an instructor) has a lot of freedom to configure the simulation, creating scenarios that can range from very simple to very complex/difficult, The Simulation Manager is also able to model specific events or situations to target specific learning goals.\nThe gameplay consists of creating one’s own enterprise and making business decisions required by the challenges defined by the instructors. This means that players have to set several parameters – price, product features, marketing, human resources, business ethics, among others – before the deadline of each period of the simulation. After the deadline, the simulation advances to the next period and the game presents the results of the previous decisions in terms of sales and profits. A performance score is provided as a weighted sum of different dimensions, and the instructor receives a detailed report with all the activities performed by the students. Every simulation is different (e.g., economic and market conditions) and parameters have to be fixed by the instructor, which makes performance not perfectly comparable, but allows for more engaging challenges. In the case of multiplayer competitions, teams compete against each other in the same settings, as in a strategy game, and computer-driven competitors are also generated, creating a good model of the market.\n\nSimulation Time Advance\nTime advances in periods that instructors/simulator manager define (hours, days, weeks, months, periods, years, etc.). Up to 24 periods can be played. Business decisions must be made at the beginning of each period. All decisions of all businesses for the period are processed at the same time, based on a schedule set by the Simulation Manager (usually the Instructor/Facilitator). For example, the Simulation Manager may choose to have decisions processed every Wednesday night, which means players must make and save their current-period decisions prior to that time each week. Any schedule can be set to reduce or extend the duration of the simulation to span days, weeks, or months. Time can also be advanced manually at the click of a button, allowing for a competition to be played within hours or minutes.\nIndividuals and Teams\nPlayers can be assigned to work individually or in teams. Each individual or team is assigned one business. Players in teams can log in to the same business at any time and from different locations. All players have access to all decisions in their business, so they must work together. Business decisions can be changed any number of times, up until the decision deadline, as set by the Simulation Manager.
